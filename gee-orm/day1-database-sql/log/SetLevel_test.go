ROOST_METHOD_HASH=SetLevel_9e9c3c4e66
ROOST_METHOD_SIG_HASH=SetLevel_27d8814d07

Scenario 1: Test behavior of the function when ErrorLevel is less than level.

Details:
  Description: This test is meant to check if the function causes the errorLog to discard the output when ErrorLevel is less than the function argument level.
Execution:
  Arrange: Initialize the ErrorLevel to a value less than the test level.
  Act: Invoke SetLevel function with the test level.
  Assert: check if the errorLog has its output set to ioutil.Discard.
Validation:
  The assertion checks if the output of errorLog is successfully discarded when ErrorLevel is less than the level. This test is essential to ensure proper logging based on the error level & logging configurations.

Scenario 2: Test behavior of the function when InfoLevel is less than level.

Details:
  Description: This test is meant to check if the function causes the infoLog to discard the output when InfoLevel is less than the function argument level.
Execution:
  Arrange: Initialize the InfoLevel to a value less than the test level.
  Act: Invoke SetLevel function with the test level.
  Assert: check if the infoLog has its output set to ioutil.Discard.
Validation:
  The assertion checks if the output of infoLog is successfully discarded when InfoLevel is less than the level. This test is important to ensure that info logging behavior functions as expected based on the logging configurations.

Scenario 3: Test behavior of the function when both ErrorLevel and InfoLevel are greater than the level.

Details:
  Description: This test is intended to confirm that when the level is lower than both ErrorLevel and InfoLevel, nothing is discarded.
Execution:
  Arrange: Initialize both ErrorLevel and InfoLevel to a value greater than the test level.
  Act: Invoke SetLevel function with the test level.
  Assert: Check if none of the logs discard their output.
Validation:
  The assertion tests if none of the logs discard their output when the Level is lower than both ErrorLevel and InfoLevel. This test is crucial to verify if the function respects the configuration based on different log levels.

Scenario 4: Test the locking mechanism to ensure concurrent safety.

Details:
  Description: This test is meant to examine if the function can handle simultaneous invocations in a safe manner.
Execution:
  Arrange: Set up multiple goroutines to invoke the SetLevel function simultaneously.
  Act: Run the goroutines.
  Assert: Check if the function can successfully run without causing a deadlock or race conditions.
Validation:
  The assertion validates the concurrent safety of the SetLevel function. The importance of this test comes from the concurrent nature of Go applications and the need for robust and safe code execution.
